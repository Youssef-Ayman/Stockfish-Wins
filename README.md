# Stockfish-Wins
Stockfish Wins is a Windows application created using C# and .NET on WPF. On Stockfish Wins you can either play against another player
on the same computer or play against Stockfish 10, the most powerful chess engine in existence. The engine is run as an exe in the 
background and is fed the move order in UCI notation. The best move is then extracted using a simple parser, and then it is carried out
by the controller.
